# Bloccit: a Reddit clone to learn the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor, Eliot Sykes, at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

Heroku app name: ellen-bloccit

[Direct link](http://ellen-bloccit.herokuapp.com)

This app allows users to register at two levels: Standard(free) and Premium(for a nominal fee), using the Devise and Stripe gems. Standard users may create and comment on Public Wikis; Premium users may create, collaborate on, and comment on Private Wikis. Users may also vote for wikis.

## Setup

ENV variables may be found in config/application.yml, and references to them are in config/application.example.yml.
